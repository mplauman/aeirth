[[Aeirth]] is a homebrew campaign world, collaboratively built out as a [spiral campaign](https://slyflourish.com/spiral_campaign_building.html).

It is driven by the choices of the players, chronicling the characters, places, stories, and villains that they've deemed important enough to bring to life.

It started in the real world sometime in 2023, with only a map of [[Mog Caern]] and surrounding region. Few details, little more than seeds thrown to the wind in a bid to see what grows.

Who knows what this could become? A glorious, rich world full of dynamic heroes and villains? Or a collection of tall tales told by idiots, weirdos, and ne'er-do-well's? Only time will tell. Bet on the latter.

> #### DM's Note
> 
> I used to think DM's needed to know everything: every god, city, NPC, and villain, down to the finest detail. As a kid I spent hours plotting out vast and intricate campaign arcs... and quickly burned out. I started, and failed, a few campaigns that way with my friends. Then I didn't play D&D for over 20 years. That's a long time!
>
> At the age of 43, two things happened simultaneously. FIrst, I decided to take the plunge and commit to a full campaign. While running that I discovered [Sly Flourish](https://slyflourish.com/) and [Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master](https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/return-of-the-lazy-dungeon-master). This was, literally, a game changer for me as a DM.
>  
> Throughout the next 3 (!) years of running that campaign, with side campaigns as folks dropped in and out due to the twin curses of Life and Circumstance, I learned the magic sauce of D&D (for me): discovering worlds *with* my players.
> 
> Every session I got to make up a bunch of stuff. And every session, my players picked the things they found valuable, interesting, and enjoyable enough to interact with. Often it was things not in the campaign, that were made up on the fly, that they appreciated the most. Or perhaps that's what stuck in my brain because I had to make it up. Either way, I was delighted that everybody at the table got to discover something.
> 
> It's that sense of discovery I hope to capture here. A great experiment, seeing how big a world we can all make up together.
