The Sly Fox Inn is a sprawling compound situated two days' travel east of [[Mog Caern]] and the last stop before entering the wilds beyond [[Fates End]].

Surrounded by a low wall, it sports a large ground floor main tavern and with multiple rooms above. There is ample space in the courtyard for carriages and a large stable able to accommodate horse and other steeds for the night.

The barkeep, [[Tor Millist]], keeps an alehouse drake as a pet/mascot.
