The line between mortality and godhood is somewhat blurry, driven more by the power of belief than any sort of birthright. They can be powerful (see below) with millions of followers and influence that spans contents. Or they can be small, with domains limited to sacred streams or groves.

History is full of new gods (both reluctant and eager) being born from nothing or ascending from the ranks of common folk. It is similarly riddled with gods who are all but dead, their followers gone and their names lost in the mists of time. 

While the number of actual gods, demi-gods, and ascendants is virtually limitless there is a relatively core pantheon that is typically worshipped throughout the lands.
