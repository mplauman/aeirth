The brothers awaken to the sounds of a carriage being unloaded outside. They try helping and surreptitiously investigate a large, heavily armoured carriage but are rebuffed. After starting a bar fight to lure the remaining guards away, they catch a glimpse of its contents before beating a hasty retreat and heading back to town.
