Working in what passes for [[Mog Caern]]'s city watch has never been glamorous, but it's a decent way to make a living. The benefits are good, the pay is decent, and you belong to what essentially amounts to a sanctioned gang. The risk is always there that you'll get roped into some sort of power game from the higher ups, and when that inevitably happens you're biggest hope quickly becomes escaping with your ass intact.

> #### DM's Note
> This was small campaign that was run while some players were out of the main one. I was pretty sure that I wanted to try my hand at a homebrew world, and this is where we first tried to get the feel for it.
> It also served as a test bed for building this site: a place where I could record all the lore that accumulates and present it to my players. Without actually paying for anything.
