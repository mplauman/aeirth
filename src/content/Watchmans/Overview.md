Working in what passes for [[Mog Caern]]'s city watch has never been glamorous, but it's a decent way to make a living. The benefits are good, the pay is decent, and you belong to what essentially amounts to a sanctioned gang. The risk is always there that you'll get roped into some sort of power game from the higher ups, and when that inevitably happens you're biggest hope quickly becomes escaping with your ass intact.
