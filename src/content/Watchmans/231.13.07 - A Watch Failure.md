Excerpt: One half brother keeps watch. The other... not so much.
Location: [[Roadside Camp]]
---
After a good days' travel, the half brothers settle down at a well used campsite situated halfway between [[Mog Caern]] and the [[Sly Fox Inn]]. As Oggogul sleeps through his watch they are beset by a smelly, water logged zombie. Oggogul softens its skull in preparation for Pally's killing blow.
