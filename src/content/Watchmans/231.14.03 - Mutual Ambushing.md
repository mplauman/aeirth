Spending the remainder of the day doubling back on their own trail, the brothers detect that they are being followed. Double-doubling back on the trail, they discover their pursuers are a pair of satyrs discovered in the strange carriage. After a tense, fire-less night the brothers engage the satyrs, culminating in a dramatic chase where the sole remaining satyr stumbles into a hornet's nest and is ignobly stung to death.
