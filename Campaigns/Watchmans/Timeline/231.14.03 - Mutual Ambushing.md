Spending the remainder of the day doubling back on their own trail, the brothers detect that they are being followed. Double-doubling back on the trail, they realize that they are being followed by the pair of satyrs from the strange carriage. After a tense, fireless night the brothers engage the satyrs, culminating in a dramatic chase where the remainign satyr stumbles into a hornet's nest and is stung to death.
