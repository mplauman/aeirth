The calendar system used in Aeirth bears a striking resemblance to [the one used in Greyhawk](https://calendars.fandom.com/wiki/Greyhawk_Calendar). It's a good calendar! Easy to use, pronouceable names, and with enough similarity to the real wold that things are easy to remember.

This will have no bearing on actual gameplay. But the timelines with dates are nice, so I had to pick something.
